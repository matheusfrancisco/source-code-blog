## About me

I'm Matheus Francisco B Machado. I'm currently living in SÃ£o Paulo BR.  I'm a computer engineer from the Federal University of Santa Catarina.  I love study about paradigms, design principals, software architecture and good practices about testing software. 

Currently I work in the leading SaaS platform in recruitment and selection using Artificial Intelligence, focusing on the backend. Using technologies like Python / Django, Nodejs, Docker, Postgres, Redis, AWS.

Throughout my career and graduate I've been lucky to work and study with inspiring people, on challenging projects, solving interesting problems. On this blog, I'm sharing my basics thoughts.
