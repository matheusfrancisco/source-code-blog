# Why did I create this blog?

I decided to create this blog because I love programming languages and themes like,
functional programming, software architecture, software testing, and design principals.
So I will be written about these themes.

The posts will be made in Portuguese and English. I will try to create posts in both languages,
because I'm trying to improve my English. so nothing better than writing in english too.

## About the blog content

Well will cover topics such as TDD, Refactoring, Software Architecture on the blog. I will try to create
posts by building some code using the techniques. I will aslo start posting a video developing systems using TDD and
Refactoring.

I will write about books and scientific articles, books like clean code, tdd, clean architecture,
best practices about software development.
I will also write about AI, Machine Learning because is the  area  I pretend to read and improve.

I hope I can help so I will leave my contacts so they can get in touch if they want to talk.
